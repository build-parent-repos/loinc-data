Order Vs Observation,Order Vs Observation,,"Defines term as order only, observation only, or both. A fourth category, Subset, is used for terms that are subsets of a panel but do not represent a package that is known to be orderable. We have defined them only to make it easier to maintain panels or other sets within the LOINC construct. This field reflects our best approximation of the terms intended use; it is not to be considered normative or a binding resolution.",Attribute,Test Orderable; Test Reportable; Test Subset
